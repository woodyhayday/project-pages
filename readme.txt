Project Pages is an opinionated Portfolio Maker. Project Pages helps you document your project stories, and make better stuff.

== Description ==

**This is for the makers.**

### üß∞ Is This a Portfolio Maker? A Portfolio Theme?

Well it's a little of both, and more. There are portfolio themes out there, and other portfolio plugins. For me these lacked structure and didn't ever end up looking how I wanted them to. Project Pages was built from the ground up for makers & creators who make cool stuff. 

Fundamentally: Project Pages helps you record projects, and present them in your WordPress site. 



### ü•∏ Who's it for?

Project Pages is for...

- Indie Makers
- Artists
- Creators
- Designers
- Film Makers
- Craftspeople

### Project Pages - The online home for stuff you make

Whether you make furniture, buildings, art, take photos, collect rare objects, or invent things: Project Pages is the perfect place to log and share your projects, (especially if you're already using WordPress).

Built by a maker, for makers. This is adaptable, simple (but not shallow!). Project Pages helps you take the essence of each thing you make, record the making process, and share it in the most constructive way possible.

## ‚ùìCommon Questions and Answers about Project Pages / Online Portfolios


**How do I make my own Portfolio website?**

There are many ways to make your own portfolio website. I'm biased, but I think Installing WordPress and Project Pages is a great way. Using my WordPress template portfolio just makes it all easy.


**What should be in a Portfolio website?**

That all depends on your aims. If you're intending to get work from this, try highlighting the work you've done already which qualifies you - perhaps client case studies, or particular projects.

If you aim is to document your work, for yourself and others then maybe put the meaningful projects in, or all of them so you can connect the dots later.


**How do I get my portfolio noticed?**

First up the thing 90% of people miss: MAKE A PORTFOLIO. So many people leave folders on their computers never to be shared publically.

Once you've got your Project Pages up, sharing becomes a consistent part of the workflow. Consistently sharing your work will get it noticed.


**How do I make my portfolio stand out?**

There's obviously a marketing aspect here, that would be better answered on the Project Pages blog. Fundamentally though, people want stories. They want to see what you've made, how you've made it, and why. 

There are many ways to make your portfolio stand out, but for me it starts with selecting projects you deeply care about or really interest you; this makes the standing out easier later because you can use the bigger context to reach more people.


**How do you promote your portfolio on LinkedIn/Social Media?**

Use Project Pages. Upload your Projects, give lots of context. Share consistently. It's one thing having a portfolio maker make you a portfolio, but the key is to contextually share your projects after you've posted them. This sends your maker story out into the social web.

**How much of this plugin is really 'free'?**

The core is most of the code, and it'll always be free. It's totally usable, in fact it's epic, on it's own. I'm building a few extra features that I needed personally, and that users have asked for; these are available in the PRO version...but even that is [pay what you want](https://projectpages.io/pro), it's just there for you to support the plugin if it's valuable to you.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I see more documentation? = 

If you're just getting started see [this guide](https://projectpages.io/docs/getting-started-with-project-pages/). You can see all of the docs [here](https://projectpages.io/docs).

= Where can I edit the page templates? =

This changed in v2.0 as Project Pages now supports block templates as well as Legacy PHP templates! 

Read the [guide on page templates here](https://projectpages.io/docs/templates/)

= How can I keeep my own theme and show projects? =

This is now the default template mode in v2.0+. Project Pages will use a gutenberg blocks template to build your pages, so your theme header and footer should show as normal around the Project Pages.

If you want to edit these, see above re: templates.

= How do I do video hero/cover backgrounds? = 

Upload your video file somewhere (use WP Media upload, or FTP). Aim to end up with an URL of an .mp4 video file.

Select the 'Video Background' option, either in the singular project editor, or in the block editor if you'd like to apply this hero background to the Archive/Taxonomy pages; and enter a Video URL.

(Pssst. There are some great video's to use as backgrounds here: pexels.com/search/videos/background/)

= Does this work with Elementor/et all? = 

With 2.0 I've brought the core of this plugin back to life and up to date. Since I first wrote this (7y ago), WordPress and it's ecosystem has evolved a fair bit. If there are any particular ideas/plugins/themes you want supported, I'm open to feature requests, which I'll do my best to roll in, where it'll benefit lots of people.

= How do I give feedback? = 

Please use the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/project-pages/) or one of the feedback forms built into the plugin.
